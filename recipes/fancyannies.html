        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is a Todd classic, best used when you have nothing planned or at the end of the week to use your leftover veggies.  If you can make Annie's you can make this recipe!  It's that easy!  While you boil water for your Annie's, chop up any veggies you want in it (I suggest kale, bell peppers, onions, and garlic).  Then sautee up your veggies while your Annie's cook, add a can of tuna at the end, mix it all together, and enjoy!</p>
