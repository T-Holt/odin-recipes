    <h1>Breakfast</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here is a surefire hit breakfast!  Best of all, like the <a href="fancyannies.html" target="_blank">Fancy Annie's</a> recipe, it uses ingredients you already have on hand and is a great way to use leftover veggies!  The basic process is simple and flexible.  Play with different combinations and methods of cooking the eggs and potatoes.  How do different fruits taste with it?  What spices compliment the dish?  Are you in the mood for something light and fresh (maybe some fresh sliced tomato topped with basil)?  Or do you want something heavier and heartier (maybe some raddichio and fennel sauteed in butter to bring out their sweetness)?  The only limit is your imagination!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here is the basic process: sautee veggies, pour scrambled eggs in, cook, serve.  This meal is really that simple!  Fry up some potatoes on the side, maybe bake a sweet potato if you have time (or if you're lucky enough to have and oven with a start timer).  Some nice toast and butter is always great.  Does your meal call for a hearty rye bread slathered in butter, or a slice of fresh sourgough, or even a day-old slice of sourdough sauteed in olive oil with garlic and rosemary?  My mouth is watering, so let's get to the "recipe."  I want to emphasize that the recipe is just a template to get you started.  Here is a meal to experiment with different ingredients, herbs, spices, and combinations!  Go to your local farmers market and ask what their favorite breakfast veggies are at the moment and try those.  Can you make it Italian inspired with tomatoes, basil, mozzarella, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar?  How about Palestinian with pomegranate, olive oil, lemon, parsley, and fava beans?</p>
