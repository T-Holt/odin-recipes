# odin-recipes
My Odin Project recipe project
This project will demonstrate my basic HTML knowledge

Reflections:
This project really helped reinforce key concepts and I learned a couple new ones.  The main new ones I learned were opening a link with target="_blank" and sizing your image just using a width to keep scale.  I also learned how to "return to top" from someone else's projet using an id tag.

Where I learned to most was in the command line and using git commands.  It was challenging to figure out how to use VSCode to wrap text and write good commit messages (mine are still pretty rough) and the experience navigating the command line helped a lot.
